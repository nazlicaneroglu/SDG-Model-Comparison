NLP Models for SDG Classification
This repository contains the code and data for my thesis on the comparison of various NLP models for classifying text into one or more Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The goal of this project is to explore and compare the performance of different NLP techniques in the context of SDG classification and to provide insights into the underlying reasons for their estimations.
